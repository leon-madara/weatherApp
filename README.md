## Description
Snap Forecast is a modern, interactive weather application designed to bridge the gap between satellite-based weather predictions and real-world ground conditions. While many weather apps rely solely on data from national weather services, they often fall short in reflecting real-time microclimate changes—especially in tropical and rapidly shifting weather zones. This discrepancy can result in forecasts showing clear skies when it's actually raining, or missing sudden weather changes altogether.

To solve this, Snap Forecast introduces a community-informed weather reporting system, allowing users to submit live, on-the-ground weather updates. These crowd-sourced reports enhance the accuracy and reliability of forecasts in specific neighborhoods or regions.

By combining:

- Real-time API weather data,

- User-submitted observations, and

- Engaging, animated 3D mascots (like Umbrella Buddy and Thunder Spirit),

Snap Forecast offers a personalized, immersive, and more human-centric approach to weather forecasting.

This project is ideal for exploring practical applications of crowdsourced data, 3D animation in UI/UX, and mobile-first design for daily utility apps.

## How It Works
Snap Forecast combines conventional weather forecasting with user-submitted data to offer a more adaptive and community-driven weather experience. Here’s how it works:

  🌤 1. Weather Data Integration
  The app pulls real-time weather data from a trusted external API (e.g., OpenWeather, WeatherAPI), providing:
  
  - Current conditions (temperature, wind, humidity, pressure)
  
  - Hourly and daily forecasts
  
  - Weather icons and alerts
  
  - This ensures a baseline level of forecast accuracy.
  
  📸 2. Community Weather Reporting
  Users can submit live updates about the weather in their location using:
  
  - Predefined tags (e.g., "Raining Now", "Very Windy", "Overcast", "Misty")
  
  - Optional photo uploads or quick notes
  
  - These reports are timestamped and geo-tagged to verify and cluster data by region.
  
  🧠 3. Smart Aggregation & Display
  The app intelligently combines API data and user reports to:
  
  - Flag inconsistencies (e.g., API says “sunny” but 10 users report “raining”)
  
  - Display alerts or warnings when crowdsourced reports deviate significantly
  
  - Update the UI to reflect what’s really happening on the ground
  
  🌈 4. Animated Mascots & Visual UI
  Depending on the weather condition, users see 3D animated mascots (e.g., Umbrella Buddy in rain, Thunder Spirit in storms), making the experience more engaging. The background adapts to weather moods—sunny, cloudy, rainy, or stormy.
  
  🧭 5. Navigation & Personalization
  Users navigate the app via a bottom navigation bar, accessing:
  
  - Home: Today’s summary + mascot
  
  - Forecast: Hour-by-hour and week view
  
  - Snap: Submit or view local weather updates
  
  Settings: Choose themes, mascots, and units
  
  🔔 6. Notifications & Alerts (Coming Soon)
  Users can opt-in for:
  
  - Sudden weather changes reported by others nearby
  
  - Daily weather summaries
  
  - Personalized mascot weather alerts

##  Community Verification & Gradient Reporting System
To preserve the accuracy and integrity of weather data, SnapForecast introduces a smart, location-based consensus model. Submissions are only considered valid within 1 square kilometer geographic grids, aligning with global mapping standards. For any user-submitted change to override the app’s existing forecast, at least 100 distinct users within that grid must submit a consistent report. This consensus threshold helps prevent outliers or malicious inputs from distorting the data, ensuring a democratic and data-backed adjustment process.

In addition, SnapForecast employs a weather gradient logic that intelligently limits submission options to maintain data coherence. Users are not allowed to input arbitrary weather conditions. Instead, the app presents context-aware choices, positioned on a spectrum—to the left or right of the current forecast. For example, if the forecast says “partly sunny”, users might see submission options like “clear sunny” on the left and “mostly cloudy” on the right. This structured range mirrors a color gradient system, where, if the base is blue (cloudy), user choices can only trend darker (stormy) or lighter (partly cloudy)—never off-track like “snow” on a hot summer day.

This balance of crowdsourced reporting, quantitative validation, and context-restricted inputs makes SnapForecast both reliably user-driven and algorithmically disciplined, reducing chaos while harnessing collective ground truth.
